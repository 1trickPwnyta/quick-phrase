### How Do I Get Set Up? ###

#### Web Application Setup ####

1. Copy the repository files to a folder on the server, for example C:\\inetpub\\<application name>.
2. Copy the Web/config.Example.php file and name it Web/config.php.
3. Modify the settings in config.php.
5. Copy either the Web/admin/Web.Dev.config or Web/admin/Web.Production.config file and name it Web/admin/Web.config.
6. If you copied the Web.Production.config file, you need to provide a value for the HTTP 403.4 redirect path.
5. Copy either the Web/tagCreation/Web.Dev.config or Web/tagCreation/Web.Production.config file and name it Web/tagCreation/Web.config.
6. If you copied the Web.Production.config file, you need to provide a value for the HTTP 403.4 redirect path.
7. Copy the Web/applicationRoot.Example.js file and name it Web/applicationRoot.js.
8. Modify the value in applicationRoot.js to reflect the root path of the web application.
9. Configure simpleSAMLphp as a SAML service provider on behalf of the web application. Instructions to do so are stored in Google Drive.
7. This application requires the following SAML user attributes:
    * An attribute called "Admin" that is set to "true" or "false" depending on whether the user was authorized to administrate this application.
    * An attribute called "EmailAddress"
8. Example IdP configuration using Kangaroo Standard IAM:

            {
                "SpId": "dev.grabtag",
                "AssertionConsumerServiceUrl": "https://dev.kangaroostandard.com/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-acs.php/dev.grabtag",
                "SingleLogoutServiceUrl": "https://dev.kangaroostandard.com/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-logout.php/dev.grabtag",
                "AttributeRequirements": [
                    {
                        "SamlAttributeName": "EmailAddress",
                        "DirectoryAttributeName": "mail"
                    },
                    {
                        "SamlAttributeName": "Admin",
                        "DirectoryAttributeName": "CN=Grab Tag Administrators,CN=Users,DC=dev,DC=kangaroostandard,DC=com"
                    }
                ]
            }

#### Android Application Setup ####

2. Go to the Grab Tag project in Adobe PhoneGap Build.
3. Click on Update code. Upload the phonegap.zip file.
4. Once the build has completed, click on the apk button to download the apk.
5. Store the GrabTag-debug.apk file in the root directory of the repository.
6. Install the build onto your device using the following command:

        adb install GrabTag-debug.apk
