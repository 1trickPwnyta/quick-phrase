### How Do I Get Set Up? ###

#### Web Application Setup ####
1. Copy the repository files to a folder on the server, for example C:\\inetpub\\<application name>.
2. Copy the Web/config.Example.php file and name it Web/config.php.
3. Modify the settings in config.php.
5. Copy either the Web/admin/Web.Dev.config or Web/admin/Web.Production.config file and name it Web/admin/Web.config.
6. If you copied the Web.Production.config file, you need to provide a value for the HTTP 403.4 redirect path.
5. Copy either the Web/tagCreation/Web.Dev.config or Web/tagCreation/Web.Production.config file and name it Web/tagCreation/Web.config.
6. If you copied the Web.Production.config file, you need to provide a value for the HTTP 403.4 redirect path.
7. Copy the Web/applicationRoot.Example.js file and name it Web/applicationRoot.js.
8. Modify the value in applicationRoot.js to reflect the root path of the web application.
9. Configure simpleSAMLphp as a SAML service provider on behalf of the web application. Instructions to do so are stored in Google Drive.
7. This application requires the following SAML user attributes:
    * An attribute called "Admin" that is set to "true" or "false" depending on whether the user was authorized to administrate this application.
    * An attribute called "EmailAddress"
8. Example IdP configuration using Kangaroo Standard IAM:

            {
                "SpId": "dev.grabtag",
                "AssertionConsumerServiceUrl": "https://dev.kangaroostandard.com/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-acs.php/dev.grabtag",
                "SingleLogoutServiceUrl": "https://dev.kangaroostandard.com/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-logout.php/dev.grabtag",
                "AttributeRequirements": [
                    {
                        "SamlAttributeName": "EmailAddress",
                        "DirectoryAttributeName": "mail"
                    },
                    {
                        "SamlAttributeName": "Admin",
                        "DirectoryAttributeName": "CN=Grab Tag Administrators,CN=Users,DC=dev,DC=kangaroostandard,DC=com"
                    }
                ]
            }
