var HELP_TEXT = "THE BASICS<br /><br />Find a group of friends and split up into two even teams. Sit in a circle, alternating between members of each team. Press the Next button, and without saying the phrase (called a &quot;tag&quot;) on the screen or any part of it, try to get your teammates to guess the tag. When the tag has correctly been guessed, quickly pass the game to the person on your left. That person tries to get their teammates to guess the next tag, and play continues around the circle.<br /><br />WINNING THE GAME<br /><br />When the time runs out, the team who is currently holding the game loses that round. Press the button to give the other team a point, and start a new round. Seven points wins the game!<br /><br />PLAYING WITH MORE THAN TWO TEAMS<br /><br />You can play with more than two teams. When you do, give a point to the team that is holding the game when the time runs out. When a team reaches seven points, they are eliminated! The game ends when only one team remains.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL RULES<br /><br />1. You can't say the tag or any part of the tag (although common words like &quot;the&quot; and &quot;of&quot; are okay). You also can't tell people &quot;it rhymes with...&quot; or &quot;it starts with the letter...&quot;, or anything else that seems like cheating.<br /><br />2. Other forms of the same word are acceptable answers. For example, if the tag is &quot;walking&quot; and someone guesses &quot;walk&quot;, it counts. But you also can't use other forms of the word as clues.<br /><br />3. You can skip one tag during your turn (press the Next button again), but then you can't skip again until the next time the game is passed to you. Once you skip, the old tag is no longer valid, and even if someone guesses it, it doesn't count.<br /><br />4. When the time runs out on you, you can either start the next round yourself, or you can pass it to the next person to start the round.<br /><br />5. If you accidentally say the tag, you must skip to the next tag if you have not already skipped this turn. Otherwise, stop the round and give the other team a point.<br /><br />";
